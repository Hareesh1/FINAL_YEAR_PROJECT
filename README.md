# 🌱 Smart Agriculture System: Crop Guidance & Disease Management 🌿

## ✨ Project Overview

This project pioneers a **smart agriculture system** that blends **IoT** and **machine learning** to revolutionize crop yield and promote sustainable farming. By integrating real-time soil data with advanced disease detection, we aim to empower farmers with data-driven insights for optimal crop selection and timely intervention against plant diseases.

## 🚀 Features

* **Optimal Crop Recommendation** 🌾: Utilizes the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm to recommend the most suitable crops based on real-time soil parameters including **pH, moisture, temperature, and rainfall**. Say goodbye to guesswork!
* **Early Disease Detection** 🦠: A robust **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model is deployed to accurately detect plant leaf diseases from images captured using an **ESP32-CAM**. Catch diseases early and protect your harvest!
* **Resource Efficiency** 💧: By providing precise guidance, the system helps in optimizing resource utilization, leading to less waste and more sustainable practices.
* **Enhanced Sustainability** 🌎: Promotes eco-friendly farming through intelligent resource management and early disease control, contributing to a healthier planet.

## 💡 How it Works

1.  **Data Acquisition**: Sensor modules connected to NodeMCU collect real-time soil parameters (pH, moisture, temperature, rainfall).
2.  **Crop Recommendation**: The collected soil data is fed into a **KNN algorithm** which then suggests the most suitable crops for the given conditions.
3.  **Image Capture**: An **ESP32-CAM** captures images of plant leaves.
4.  **Disease Detection**: These images are processed by the **CNN model** to identify and classify any potential plant leaf diseases.
5.  **Actionable Insights**: Farmers receive recommendations for optimal crops and alerts for detected diseases, enabling timely and informed decisions.

## 📈 Achievments

* **Improved Resource Efficiency**: Significant reduction in water and nutrient wastage.
* **Early Disease Detection**: Minimized crop loss due to prompt identification and treatment of diseases.
* **Sustainable Farming Practices**: Empowered farmers to adopt environmentally conscious methods.
